## Demo

We are currently working on a demo. Coming real soon!

## Welcome to CardScript

CardScript is a interactive card making website where you can share your wildest creations with your friends on our forums. Cardscript will allow you to build completely custom cards or you can check out the shop for inspiration.

### Pages

We will eventually add examples here once we build the website.

### Mobile Support

The main feature of this web app is to allow creativity with a card builder; mobile support becomes tricky. We may eventually create a lightweight version to adjust your cards but nothing too heavy.
On mobile, the main goal is to be able to keep contact with your friends and followers. We want users to always be up to date on the lastest designs.

### Features

- Custom Card Builder
- Show off your collection in your very own profile
